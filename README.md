# COMP639_group_7_project1

This group project was developped collaboratively by myself, @fangxin-tang, @nayxie, @shulinzhaozhao, and @SimonEccleston over a span of 4 weeks from August to September, 2023. It served as an assessment for the COMP639 Studio Project at Lincoln University.

The project entailed the development of a full-stack web application that utilises Python and Flask for the backend, Jinja templating, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, along with a MySQL database.
